        Isn't it interesting how the World has advanced in technology and continues in its advancement each day? From time memorial till date, cell phone has evolved in many ways from a change in shape, features and many others. Well beginner cell phones were primarily for the purpose of making calls but that focus has shifted from making calls to now a multimedia tool. 
        Yes, a Multimedia tools because mobile phones as they are called now are mostly used for checking mails, browsing or surfing the internet, snapping photos etc. 
        But what interest us the most is that brand of a mobile phone that goes by the name “iPhone” that has being in the system for quite some number of years providing the world with some cool stuff to enjoy and be happy about. 
        Quoting from Wikipedia a multilingual free online encyclopedia about the history of iPhone, we read “The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. These devices use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS update. As of November 1, 2018, more that 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold. The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen. It connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls, browse the web, take pictures, play music and send and receive emails and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger screen sizes, shooting video, waterproofing, the ability to install third-party mobile apps through an app store, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel -less front screen design with app switching activated by gesture recognition. The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android, forming a large part of the luxury market”. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone)

      <h3>Apple iPhone Operating System Security</h3>
      <p>
       <ol>
        Being secured in everything is key to life and that is what iPhone iOS stands for. 
        From an article found at “COMPUTERWORLD” dated on June 6, 2011, written by Robert Lemos an award- winning freelance journalist, he shared what he termed as “Apple's iOS, why it's the most secure OS, period”. In his remarks, he said “In five major areas, Apple's iOS has better security than desktop operating systems and matches or exceeds the security of its smartphone rivals. iOS has a strong set of security features, including: 
        <li>A sandbox isolates programs, and iOS's memory organization makes exploitation more difficult.</li>
        <li>Applications that run on the iOS are vetted by Apple and can be removed if found to be malicious.</li>
        <li>Patches can be quickly applied to the iPhone and iPad to close security holes in the operating system.</li> 
        <li>The software is regularly reviewed, especially its open-source components.</li>
        <li>The platform has the advantage of attacker psychology -- attackers still target smartphones far less than desktop systems”.</li>
