    <h2>Joe</h2>
    <p>I am Joshua Yamoah Yankson from Ghana specifically the Eastern Region part of Ghana! 
        I am Married to a beautiful Wife and we are blessed with a baby Boy.
        I love playing Table Tennis...maybe I should say I am talented at that! I also Love to eat.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a degree/major in Applied Technology! I have always Loved BYU Online learning for the hands-on/practical 
        nature of their teaching. I know One would be equipped with the necessary skills after a scuccessful completion of a course.
        Well I have been a member of the church for 10yrs now...! I seek to learn more from peers who lOVE to also share
        knowledge and ideas necessary for growth!</p>
